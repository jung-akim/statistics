# Description of the dataset:
# This dataset was used for data mining project at Univeristy of GuimarÃ£es, Portugal to predict
# student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools, Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira.
# The dataset has 395 students with the attributes including students' first, second, and final Math exam scores,
# demographic, social, and school-related features collected by using school reports and questionnaires.
# The perfect score for each exam is 20.
# The third exam score(G3) has a strong correlation with the first exam(G1) and the second exam(G2)
# with r = 0.80 and r = 0.90 respectively.

# The histograms above show the dispersity of continuous variables age, the number of absences, and grade in the dataset.
# In "Dispersity in Student Age", it is shown that the majority of students who come to school is about 15-18 years old.
# For absences, most of the students miss 0-5 classes.

# 'B' is also rare for those in a relationship who study more than 2 hours per week.

# Also, when those in a relationship are more likely to fail than those who are single,
# if they spend less than 2 hours on studying per week.
# Those who are single and study more than 10 hours per week, 9% of them get 'A'.
# Failure rate for those who study 2~10 hours per week is similar between those who are
# in a relationship or not in a relationship.

# From the first box plot, we can verify that the mean score between those who study 5~10 hours is
# not much different than those who study more than 10 hours per week.
# From the second box plot, we can see that those who hang out very high has the lowest average score.
